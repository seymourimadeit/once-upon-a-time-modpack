What is it about? (VERY W.I.P)

Once Upon a Time is an attempt to bring an experience that alleviates the potential for the "2 week Minecraft phase" by focusing on overhauling progression via the use of technology and magic. The main mods intended for this use are Modern Industrialization and Ars Nouveau.

Intended changes from Early game to End game

- Leather armor is intended as a viable early game option to protect oneself and as a proper precursor to iron
  - Each piece now costs at least 3 pieces of leather and 2 pieces of string, with the exception of leather boots, which only cost 2 pieces of leather!
  - Leather armor is now required for making chainmail or gold armor
  - Chainmail armor is now required to make iron armor
  - Iron armor is now required to make diamond armor
  - Iron armor is only able to be made by a smithing template which is made in a machine unlocked during the steel age of Modern Industrialization

Diamonds no longer drop from diamond ores as diamond ores drop themselves now.

  - Diamonds can be found early and mid game via exploring structures
  - Diamond ores can be processed via an implosion chamber, but that’s gonna take a while to get…
  - Smithing template for diamonds can be made by machines
  - Don’t think you can cheat this system. All iron and diamond armors and tools have been deleted from every loot table they appear in and replaced by their raw ingot/gem counterpart

Bundles
  - Metal Bundles has been added to help with inventory management

Big Brain and Infernal Mobs have been added to make combat a bit more challenging

Changes from the combat snapshots have been added in just to even the scales
The player is encouraged to use Ars Nouveau’s spells to counter these buffed mobs

- Ender Dragon

  - Trying to beat the Ender Dragon shall be a lot slower as per the slowed down progression this pack provides. I reccomend that you spend most of your time building instead of grinding here.
    
  - Uses End Remastered system, get eyes from beating various challenges
 
  - Specifics:
     - Eye of Discovery, crafted from pieces dug up from various archeological sites (there's more than just the trail ruins in this pack) ![Archeology](https://github.com/seymourimadeit/once-upon-a-time-modpack/blob/main/pack_images/2024-12-31_20.45.36.png)
     - Eye of Omniousness, found in loot from omnious trials. ![Trial](https://github.com/seymourimadeit/once-upon-a-time-modpack/blob/main/pack_images/2024-12-31_20.43.47.png)
     - Eye of Bygones, compress 4 sculk from Ancient Cities to obtain this eye. ![Ancient City](https://github.com/seymourimadeit/once-upon-a-time-modpack/blob/main/pack_images/2024-12-31_20.50.15.png)

     - Eye of Greed, defeat a raid (more difficult than before, intact villages are less common and illagers will spawn with armor. ![Raid](https://github.com/seymourimadeit/once-upon-a-time-modpack/blob/main/pack_images/2024-12-31_21.02.18.png)

     - Eye of Ghoulishness, mutate a zombie and slay it. ![Mutant Zombie](https://github.com/seymourimadeit/once-upon-a-time-modpack/blob/main/pack_images/2024-12-31_21.01.06.png)
- On Mutants:
  - Mutants are made via enhancing a strength potion with uranium-235 dust in a brewing stand (which is obtained by putting uranium dust in a centrifuge). They do not naturally spawn
  - Mutants are intended to be the most powerful bosses in this modpack, with them always spawning with infernal mobs modifiers… luckily you should be able to counter these with the Ars Nouveau spells.
