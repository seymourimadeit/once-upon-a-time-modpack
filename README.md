What is it about? (VERY W.I.P)

Once Upon a Time is an attempt to bring an experience that alleviates the potential for the "2 week Minecraft phase" by focusing on overhauling progression via the use of technology and magic. The main mods intended for this use are Modern Industrialization and Ars Nouveau.

Intended changes from Early game to End game

- Beds now require ‘cloth’ items from zombies

  - I stole this from Better Than Adventure, please don’t sue me….

  - Now work as ‘save points,’ basically restoring your inventory from the last time you saved it (See Respawn Save Points mod for reference)

- Stone tools have been replaced by copper tools in order to elongate the early game a tiny bit

  - I stole this from Raspberry Flavored… please I have unpaid debt to the mafia don’t sue me!!!!

- Leather armor is intended as a viable early game option to protect oneself

  - Each piece now costs at least 3 pieces of leather and 2 pieces of string, with the exception of leather boots, which only cost 2 pieces of leather!

  - Leather armor is now required for making chainmail or gold armor

  - Chainmail armor is now required to make iron armor

  - Iron armor is now required to make diamond armor

  - Iron armor is only able to be made by a smithing template which is made in a machine unlocked during the steel age of Modern Industrialization

- Diamonds no longer drop from diamond ores as diamond ores drop themselves now.

  - Diamonds can be found early and mid game via exploring structures

  - Diamond ores can be processed via an implosion chamber, but that’s gonna take a while to get…

  - Smithing template for diamonds can be made by machines

  - Don’t think you can cheat this system. All iron and diamond armors and tools have been deleted from every loot table they appear in and replaced by their raw ingot/gem counterpart

- Bundles

  - Metal Bundles has been added to help with inventory management

- Big Brain and Infernal Mobs have been added to make combat a bit more challenging
  
  - Changes from the combat snapshots have been added in just to even the scales

  - The player is encouraged to use Ars Nouveau’s spells to counter these buffed mobs

- Ender Dragon

  - Trying to beat the Ender Dragon shall be a lot slower as this modpack will try to aim for more “chill” vibes

  - Uses End Remastered system, get eyes from beating various challenges

  - Specifics:

  - Corrupted Eye, found by beating a raid (extra hard with Illagers Wear Armor)

  - Guardian Eye, crafted from 3 Elder Guardian Eye fragments (100% drop rate)

  -  Undead Eye, dropped from Mutant Zombie (more on them later)

  - Rogue Eye, dropped from Mutant Creeper

  - Cursed Eye, dropped from Mutant Enderman

  - Black Eye, dropped by Mutant Skeleton

  - Nether Eye, dropped by Wildfire

  - Evil Eye, dropped by Ominous Trial Vault loot

  - Wither Eye, dropped by Wither

  - Evil Eye, do an ominous trial for a chance at earning this!

  - Old Eye, found by fragments in archeology

  - Lost Eye, founded in Ancient cities (replaces soul compass stuff, which we might as well remove with the addition of minimap mods)
  
  - Cold Eye, obtained by fighting the Wilden Chimera!

- On Mutants:

  - Mutants are made via enhancing a strength potion with uranium-235 dust in a brewing stand (which is obtained by putting uranium dust in a centrifuge). They do not naturally spawn!

  - Mutants are intended to be the most powerful boss, with them always spawning with infernal mobs modifiers… luckily you should be able to counter these with the Ars Nouveau spells.
